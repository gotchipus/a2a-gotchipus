# Gotchipus A2A Protocol

This repository contains the open-source implementation of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol for Gotchipus, a revolutionary dNFT pet project blending GameFi, modular smart contracts, and onchain AI agents.

Gotchipus creates living, soul-linked octopus companions, each with a unique 256-bit DNA ID and 33,000 genes, offering 10^33,000 possible combinations. Powered by EIP-2535, ERC-6551, and custom Hooks, Gotchipus pets evolve, act autonomously, and interact with DeFi ecosystems.

The A2A Protocol enables Gotchipus AI agents to collaborate seamlessly, handling tasks like gene evolution, Hook execution, and DeFi operations. This repository provides a Python-based backend (using Sanic) to integrate A2A agents into the Gotchipus ecosystem.
